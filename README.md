# py-hpi
The Python HDL Procedural Interface implements a mechanism for Python scripts and
HDL (Verilog, VHDL, and SystemVerilog) to interact at the procedural level. 
Interacting at the procedural level enables support for a broader set of
simulators, and supports a broader range of integation styles than does integration
at the signal level from the design periphery.

# Theory of Operations

## BFMs

### Python Side
- Python class
  - Registration of class
  - Registration of methods
  
- BFM registry


### HDL Side

## Wrapper Generation

# Launcher
- Command-line arguments
- Specification of python paths
- Loading of Python modules
- Entry point (?)
